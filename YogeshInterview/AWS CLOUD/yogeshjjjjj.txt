Deploying the build in dev and QA Environment.

    Q: How you are deploying the build in your environment.

      Ans: 
           In order to deploy the build in DEV environment 
           - We run a Jenkins job, by giving branch name and GIT hash, so that it will create the AMI's in Dev account. 
           - Then we run deployment script, to deploy the code stack on existing Infra stack.
           - Then we wait for 30 min so that Instance will come up and Ansible will copy the public keys to all instance. 
             So that we can able to ssh with our private key.
           - Then we login to each instance and check all services are up or not. If not then we start it. If it is not starting
           - Then we check logs and troubleshoot it.
           - Then we delte the older code stack from cloud formation.
           - And give the new ELB end points to dev team.
