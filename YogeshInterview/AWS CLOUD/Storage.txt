# Disk Storage For Compute

## Harddisk
    * EBS
        * No Matter what machine you create root volume is ebs
        * Non epheremal
    * Instance-Store
        * Is always secondary for some machine types
        * ephemeral
* Is a paid service
* free tier
    * 30 GB hardisk is free

* Harddisk by Hardware
    * Magnetic
    * HDD
    * SSD
* Harddisk by Speed
    * IOPS
        * 1 IOPS => 256 kib/s
    * More IOPS more cost& speed

* Volume Types in Amazon 
    * General Purpose SSD
    * Provisioned IOPS SSD
    * Throughput optimized (It is cheaper with more storage and costlier than cold hdd)
    * Cold HDD (It is cheaper with more storage)

* EBS Volume can be attached to only one machine at any given point of time
* Backup
    * Snapshot 
        * Full & then incremental 
*  Can i change harddisk size/type while machine is running?
    * No (1 year ago)
    * yes (Elastic Volumes)
    * When you change
        * To reflect this it takes time
        * if you want to see immedietly restart
* From Snapshots =>  
       * Create EBS Volumen
       * Create AMI

* AMI => Snapshot + Metadata
### Network Drives (SAN, NAS)

* EFS 
    * Works with linux
    * Not directly with windows
    * EFS => Region Wise
            => FOr every AZ a shared network storage is created 
            => Amazon syncs the data between az

### Blob Storage (Not file system)

* Simple Storage Service(S3)
   * Upload files to s3
   * individual file size cannot be greater that 4TB
   * Usecases
        * Streaming
        * Alternative to FTP
        * Backup & Archival Solutions
    * Cost is two fodler
        * Cost for storage
        * access costs
    * AWS has storage classes
        * Standard
        * infrequenct access
        * reduced redundancy
        * Glacier (archival)
    * S3 Lifecycle Transition
            30 => Standard
            30-60 => IA
            60-90 => archive
            120=> expire/delete
    * S3 Versioning
        * Enable Versioning
        * Suspending Versioning



AWS Storage Note 17 May 2019 NO Practice

## Storage in AWS
# Non Cloud Storage
 * Harddisk's
 * Network Storage/Storage Area Networks
 * FTP
Cloud Storages
* Blob Storage:
  * Storage over https
     usecases:
      * Replaces FTP
      * Media (video/audio)
      * Document Storage (Versioning)
      * Backup & Archival
AWS Specific:
 * Simple Storage Service (S3)
Cost
 * Storage
 * Transfer

Harddisk
Terms that decide:
  Type:
   * SSD
   * HDD
   * Magnetic
Size
Speed
AWS Specifics:
  Two kinds of Harddisk by thier placement
   * instance storage
   * EBS (Elastic Block Storage)
Type of Hardisk by hardware
 * Magnetic
 * HDD
 * SSD
Speed: IOPS
Size:
Cost:
  * Size, Speed & Type
Network Disk

  * Storage on Network
     * Elastic File Storage
Database (Special Treatment internally a harddisk)

Backup & Restore Data from various kinds of storage

Terms of intrest: 
  * GiBi Byte, Mibi Byte (*bi)

Size:

1 MB = 1024 kB
Size measured in

1 Killo = 1000
1 Kibi = 1024
Speed of Storage:

IOPS = IO per second





AWS  Elastic Volume storage Note 18 May 2019

Qns: can you increse the size of instance volume.
ans: yes
     how: 
         create the volume in same availability zone and attach the volume of machine.
login into the machine 
format the new create volume
create the directoty
mount the directoty of new volume.

Qns: how the increse the size of existing volume.
ans: i can increse the size of root volume and secondary volume. in this case modify the size of existing volume.

Qns: how to increse the size the instance from diff. region and diff . availability zone.
ans: in this case we first create the snapshot then increase the size of instance volume(root , secondary)
   



google: EBS volume types
         read the docs.

1 IOPS =>  256/ks
Type Of EBS:
in general purpose you donot determine the size of EBS . it determine by the amazon itself
in provisioning iops : is used for increase the speed .
Throught optimized
cold optimized



snapshot is less cost storage than harddisk
what is snapshot:
 shapshot is the backup/restore the harddisks
Type of snapshot:
1.Full Backup:
            Take the first time snapshot is called the Full backup
2. incremental Backup:
                    Take the snapshot after first snapshot is called the incremental shapshot.

Qns:
   can  i delete the snapshot:
Ans: yes
   * if delete the latest or shapshot the data will be losted
   * but delete the older shapshot data is not lost because data is copied in the latest shanshot.


Instance Storage:
               instance storage in aws depends of instance type.

Harddisk connect only one machine at the same time.

But Sometime One Harddisk connect more virtual machine.
  this is possibe with the help of NAS/SAN  in EFS (Elastic file storage)




AWS  Elastic Volume storage Practice 18 May 2019

create a ec2 machine
login into machine
sudo df -h
Note: how to add the volume in existing instance
 the volume create of same availability zone
attatch the volume
      select linux id 
                     ok
google: attatch ebs volume in existing instance.
again:
     login into machine
      sudo df -h
sudo lslbk
sudo df -h
Format the new volume 
sudo mkfs -t ex4 /dev/xvdf
sudo mkdir /extraspace
mount /dev/xvdf /extraspace
sudo df -h

********************************************

Create a window machine.
create a volume in same availability 
attach the volume:
              instance id ......
                            ok
login into windows machine
right click on computer and click on device manager
=> disk managenet
 Right click on Disk 1 
                     right click online
 again right click on disk 1
                      click on initialize disk
                                          ok
right click on unallocated
                  create a new volume
                       next  ..
goto the computer and see the drive.

****************************************

How can increase the size of secondary volume.
goto the vloume
click on action:
              modify the volume
                put the size
                      ok

test the size increae or not:
Login into linux machine
sudo df -h
sudo reboot
login again into the ec2 machine
sudo lsblk
mountmount /dev/xvdf /extraspace
sudo df -h

***************************


goto the vloume
click on action:
              modify the volume
                put the size
                      ok


login into the window machine
right click on computer
disk manager
 disk management
right click on allocated disk 
format the disk
right click again and click on shrink vloume.
