* Cloud Watch logs



## Monitoring with Cloud Watch

 
Amazon CloudWatch is a component of Amazon Web Services (AWS) that provides monitoring for AWS resources and the customer applications
 running on the Amazon infrastructure. ... The app can also detect and shut down unused or underused EC2 instances.




What is cloud watch:
               * The cloud watch is monitorining and logining service of aws.

Whats is metrics:
               * Metrics is information about the cpu utilization, network, storage and other thing.

### Setup
setup:
* atleast two ec2 machines with detailed monitorning enebled.
Activites:
* look at metrics:
  what is metrics:
                metrics is information about the virtual machine.as like cpu details ,network details, storage details.

### Step:
     select any machine see into bottum and click on monitorining and see 
     metrics .metrics are individual instance and group of instance.

### To See the load in graphical way into screen.
Step:
 * login into aws accout and click on service: and type cloudwatch
  *create deshboard and put the name of deshboard. deshboard see the graph.
  click on line graph : enter and want to see metrics about the cpu metrics.
  
### Now i want to see metrics about per-instance. 
   * click on per-instance  goto instace console and copy the instance id and metcrics page and see metrics about the this ec2 instance information.

### This is not a good way to see the load. thay why i am using the alarm schem in cloud watch monotoring service.




###  or Another step:


## monitoring with cloud watch

## Setup
* create a two ec2 machine .
* right click on ec2 machine and enabled the cloud watch.

*click on monitoring and see the metrics .
* click on another machine and see the metrics.

note: see the individual metrice is not a good way. see the metrics in the group.
go to the service:
 search the cloudwatch
  create the deshboard
  name of deshboard: learning
   create the deshboard.
  select the line graph
   configure
name of my name: cpu utilization.
   here . you can choose you want about the metrics.
    i choose the ec2 service.
  click on all instance 
 select the cpu utilization :: its show the metcics (information about the how much cpu is utilize.) in the graph format.
  click on widget
note: here you can see any type of metrics.

here i want to add another widget and select the another graph 
  and till i want to metrics only per-instance.
 select cpu utilization and create the widget. and see the metrics only one machine.
 again you can check metrics about the another machine.

 
note. here i want to see the performance about the network of per-instance or all instance.
   add widget
   select setch graph
     select the ec2 machine (select which machine you want the metrics about the machine.)
      click configure
       select per-instance
        select network packet
          configure.



note: if you want to show the live graph.
goto service
 connect 
copy the ssh file and paste the gitbashhere. 
#then login into machine.
#sudo yum install stress. (this command is used for)create the artifical load  you will see change in network graph.


note: increae the  artifical load use the below given the command.

run the stress command
run the stress --cpu 8 --io 4 --vm 2 --vm 2 --vm-bytes 10 --timeout 100s -v this command increase the cpu utilization.


Note: search the task manager.
      click on performance
        and see the  live utilization of cpu




### Note: As a aws Engineer. you do not see the graph always . ki cpu utilation increase or not.
   thay is why we you the alarm concept.
   in aws case we learn the Alarm concept for solving the more utilazation power. 

what is alarm:
alarm is just like the state.
ex: if cpu utilization is more accroding to the condition you get the alarm
    if network packets more ou get the alarm.

State of alarm:
* ok (in ok state the alarm is not ringing.)
* alarm 
* insufficient()



### Practice:

* Log in into ubuntu machine & Execute following
```
sudo apt-get update 
sudo apt-get install stress -y
stress --cpu 1 --io 4 --vm 2 --vm-bytes 128M --timeout 15m -v
`
### Note:  you crate the alarm to get the alert the cpu utilization is more than 70% then cpu utilization is crack.

step: to create alarm.
 goto the cloud watch service
 click on alarm
 create the alarm
  select the metrics
  click on ec2 
  per-instance
  select the metrice(i select the cpu utilization.)
  select the machine.
   select the metrics.
  name of alarm:
  Description:
  cpu utilization: 70
   notification:
       state in Alarm
   send the notification list
   i click on new list
  email id:
 create Alarm.
  i will  do configure.
          open the gmail and confirm the notifaction.



two kind of metrics
1. metrics difine by aws
2. metrics defined bt self.

google. create custom metrics. and see the documentation.

                 Troubleshooting:

VPC flow logs: 
               VPC Flow Logs is a feature that enables you to capture information about the IP traffic going to 
               and from network interfaces in your VPC. the flowlogs data can be published into cloudwatch log or amazon s3.

Flow Logs Basics
             You can create a flow log for a VPC, a subnet, or a network interface. If you create a flow log for a subnet or VPC, 
             each network interface in the VPC or subnet is monitored.



Flow Log Records
A flow log record represents a network flow in your flow log. Each record captures the network flow for a specific 5-tuple,

Flow Log Record Syntax:
     <version> <account-id> <interface-id> <srcaddr> <dstaddr> <srcport> <dstport> <protocol> <packets> <bytes> <start> <end> <action> <log-status>

### Practice: 1.

service 
cloudwatch
click on log section 
create key group
name of loggroup ok
go back for vpc
your vpc
flow log
cretae flow log
select all
select log group 
iam role; flowrolelog
ok....


ec2 
  security group
    remove ssh

once done your activity
go to in cloud watch  
log 
flowlogs



### Practice: 2

vvvimp.
flowlogs showing where is the packet coming in where is the packet out 
what is the source port and what is the destination port.
service
check the machine and copy the pem file and paste ino gitbashhere and see the what is the respond




main Step:
create a vpc
create a two subnet
create a network nacl 
attach nacl to the first subnet
create a ec2 machine into fisrst subnet
create a log group into cloudwatch
attach the flow log 
goto vpc and attach the flow log.
copy the pem file and paste into gitbash here
and try to login into machine 
but result is connection timeout
goto cloudwatch and click on log and attch the flow log
check the result.

flow logs tells incoming packet and outgoing packet source port and destination port.








google: aws ephemeral port


Note: ephemeral port are port which are open with the vpc
      these ephemeral port are used for different purpose.such that 
      for window open these port to be open ,for load balancer these port to be open.



note: you create a nacl and associated to the subnet and open 
the 22 port and other ports are off these 22 ports are called the 
ephemeral port
ex: 22
 0.0.0.0/22 allow

note: read the documentation
     ephemeral ports



Note: executed the scripts at the time of startup .this scripts will run when
      machine is created. scripts may be install some software ,creating file.
      useradata is the scripts which executed only once.

google: shebang

userdata:
            #!/bin/bash
              sudo apt-get install apache2 -y
       copy the public key and check httpd server page found or not
result: no
because: 80 port is not open.

open the 80 port from security group and check httpd page found or not
result: no

* copy the pem file and paste gitbash here and restart the httpd service
and copy the publib key and paste in url and check the httpd found or not

result: found

where to find logs of ec2
upload logs of ec2 to cloudwatch



                             go to ec2 machine 
                              and check the status check
                               and monitorning





  
#### Practical:

*create a ec2 machine and enable the cloudmonitorning
* click on status check
 status check are two types
1. instance status
2. system status:
when status check fail and the alarm with the help of email 
solution: when status check fail terminate the unnecessary machine.



practical:

click on machine 
right clik 
        instance setting
                     instance screenshot



instance setting
             system log



instance setting
              right click
                    change user data


instance setting
             right click
                chage the behavour
                             there are two behaviour
                                stop the machine      start the machine.




right click on ec2 machine
                 create Template from instance
something called the launch the template.
advantage of template:
             do not configure the instance type, configure instance security group ,add tag and other
              thing again and again.

here you can the value .

note: practical:
  write some your data
     yum install apache2
       #/bin/bash
       apt-get install httpd
               check in to logs
