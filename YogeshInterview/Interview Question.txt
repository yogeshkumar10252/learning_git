---------------------

Qns: How many container running your company in Prod Environment for one app.
Ans: As of now we are in process of migrating our monolitinc appication into micro services. Currently our micro service appilcation is in dev 
     environment. Our Dev team is about to complete the migration by end of this year. Till now we have around 110 (Hundred n Ten)containers for
     our application.

     We are using Docker for contenirization and Openshift for orchestration. Currently I am wirting only Docker file for microservices, creating 
     Images and pushing it to internal repository. Then a CI/CD pipeline is created in Openshift by my Lead.


Qns: suppose you have a 40 conatiner is prod environment. if any Container is died how can handle this condition.
Ans: Then This will be taken tace by Replication controller of Openshift.
     Openshift is using Docker an dKubernetes in Background.
     Replication Controller: 


Qns: How the to the conatiner in prod, dev, and QA environments.

Ans:


Qns How to remove old Docker containers?
Ans: To remove one or more Docker images use the docker container rm command followed by the ID of thecontainers you want to remove. If you get an error similar to the following, it means that the container is running. You'll need to stop the container before removing it.

     docker rmi <Image Name / Image ID>
     docker rm <Container ID/ COntainer name>


Qns: How can I copy files from the Docker container to the host?
Ans: HOSTPATH -> CONTAINER:PATH. To copy filesfrom the host to a container one can use the `docker exec` command available since Docker1.3.0. When executed, the file is transferred from the current directory to the container 

Qns:  How to get a Docker container's IP address from the host?
Ans:  Modern Docker client system

 docker inspect -f '{{range .NetworkSettings.Networks}}{{.IPAddress}}{{end}}' container_name_or_id


Qns: How to copy Docker images from one host to another without using a repository?
Ans: You will need to save the Docker image as a tar file:
    docker save -o <path for generated tar file> <image name>
   Then copy your image to a new system with regular file transfer tools such as cp or scp. After that you will have to load the image into Docker:

ex:   docker save -o c:/myfile.tar centos:16
      docker load -i <path to image tar file>


Qns. From inside of Docker container how do I connect to local host of the machine? 
Ans: Use --network="host" in your docker run command, then 127.0.0.1 in your docker container will point to your docker host.
  docker run --network="host" -d -P 



Qns:So I have a Nginx running inside a docker container, I have a mysql running on localhost, I want to connect to the MySql

     not bound on the ip address of the machine.

Ans: 

Qns: Where are Docker images stored on the host machine?
Ans: the image are stored into /var/lib/docker 
  for more info you can use the docker info


Qns: How to remove old and unused Docker images?
Ans: Remove dangling and unused images. Docker provides a docker image prune command that can be used to remove dangled and unused images.
     You'll be prompted to continue, use the -f or --force flag to bypass the prompt. When removing dangling images, 
     if the images build by you are not tagged they will be removed too.


Qns: How do I pass environment variables to Docker containers?
Ans: You can pass the values of environment variables from the host to your containers without much effort. Simply don't specify a 
     value in the command line, and make sure that the environment variable is named the same as the variable the containerized app expects: 
     $ docker run -e var_name (...)


Qns: How to force Docker for a clean build of an image?
Ans: I have build a Docker image from a Docker file using the below command.
     $ docker build -t u12_core -f u12_core .
    
   you can rebuild the image without cache or clean build of an image.
   docker build --no-cache -t u12_core -f u12_core

Qns: How to change repository name or rename image?
Ans:  docker tag <old_name> <new_name>
      docker rmi <old_name>

  ex: docker container update --cpus 4 id of the container.
  
 for : memeory : -memory , -m  
ex: docker container update -m 500M id of the container.



Qns: How to push a docker image to a private repository?
Ans: Go into the hub, and create the repository first, and mark it as private. Then when you push to that repo, it will be private. 
     This is the most common approach. log into your docker hub account, and go to your global settings.

Qns: Where is the Docker daemon log?

Windows 10	%APPDATA%\Local\Docker\log.txt




Qns: What is the best way to add users to a Docker container?
Ans:  The trick is to use useradd instead of its interactive wrapper adduser. I usually create users with:

RUN useradd -ms /bin/bash newuser

which creates a home directory for the user and ensures that bash is the default shell.
You can then add:
USER newuser
WORKDIR /home/newuser

to your dockerfile. Every command afterwards as well as interactive sessions will be executed as user newuser:

docker run -t -i image
newuser@131b7ad86360:~$

      run       Run a command in a new container.

    docker run = docker create + docker start

Qns: How to change Root password inside a Docker container?
Ans: To set the root password inside a Docker container:
1. Log in as root: docker exec -ti -u root containerID /bin/bash.
2. Use the passwd command to change the password.
3. Commit changes in Docker (i.e., docker commit).


Qns: Is there any way to add restarting policies to a container?
Ans: docker update --restart=always <container>

Qns: How to take the backup of etcd in kubernetes.
ans: Normally, start the etcd cluster and do the kubeadm init on the master node with etcd endpoints.
    Make sure you put the backup certificates into /etc/kubernetes/pki folder before kubeadm init. It will pick up the same certificates.


google: https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/administer-cluster/configure-upgrade-etcd/#restoring-an-etcd-cluster
Qns:
ans: Backing up an etcd cluster can be accomplished in two ways: etcd built-in snapshot and volume snapshot.
     1. etcd supports built-in snapshot, so backing up an etcd cluster is easy.
        A snapshot may either be taken from a live member with the etcdctl snapshot save command or by copying the member/snap/db file 
       Command:
           
   elow is an example for taking a snapshot of the keyspace served by $ENDPOINT to the file snapshotdb:

ETCDCTL_API=3 etcdctl --endpoints $ENDPOINT snapshot save snapshotdb
# exit 0

# verify the snapshot
ETCDCTL_API=3 etcdctl --write-out=table snapshot status snapshotdb
+----------+----------+------------+------------+
|   HASH   | REVISION | TOTAL KEYS | TOTAL SIZE |
+----------+----------+------------+------------+
| fe01cf57 |       10 |          7 | 2.1 MB     |
+----------+----------+------------+------------+


2: Volume snapshot
If etcd is running on a storage volume that supports backup, such as Amazon Elastic Block Store, back up etcd data by taking a snapshot of the storage volume.


Qns: my etcd size is 20 GB. my application is run . after some times etcd storage is full. then in this case we need to increase the size of etcd . how.
ans: 





Another way to take the backup of etcd:
I have to use etcdctl to backup the etcd db so I sh into the etcd pod running on the master node to do it from there: 
kubectl exec -it -n kube-system etcd-ip-x-x-x-x sh	


NOTE: The master node hosts the etcd database in this path 
/var/lib/etcd which is mounted on the pod as a VolumeMount in /var/lib/etcd



Qns: Upgrading and rolling back etcd clusters
ans: As of Kubernetes v1.13.0, etcd2 is no longer supported as a storage backend for new or existing Kubernetes clusters. 
     Kubernetes v1.5.1: etcd3 support added, new clusters still default to etcd2


Qns: How to increse the size of etcd. in kubernets.
ans: we can find the etcd in .kube folder to increse the size this we can add  a  datadisk and mount to this location.
     another way to add the create the parttion and mount the partition to the etcd.

Qns: What is S3
 AWS has storage classes
        * Standard
        * infrequenct access
        * reduced redundancy
        * Glacier (archival)
    * S3 Lifecycle Transition
            30 => Standard
            30-60 => IA
            60-90 => archive
            120=> expire/delete


Volume Types in Amazon 
    * General Purpose SSD
    * Provisioned IOPS SSD
    * Throughput optimized (It is cheaper with more storage and costlier than cold hdd)
    * Cold HDD (It is cheaper with more storage)

Instacnce Family:
General purpose
computer-optimized
storage-optimized

Qns: What is 2/2 Checks:

Ans:  If status checks shows status 2/2 checked passed, then the instance is in healthy state.

AWS EC2 provides status checks that detect the problems with the underlying EC2 system used by the individual system. 
   There are two types of checks performed every five minutes, which return a pass or a fail status. The two checks are:

System Reachability 
               Check, which confirms that AWS is able to get the network packets to the user’s instance.


Instance Status Check,
 which detects a problem within the EC2 instance.If both the checks are passed, the overall status of the instance will be OK.
   If one of the checks fails, the overall status of the instance will be impaired. The following guide demonstrates how to set the status 
   check alerts for the instance.

The sample probable reasons for the failure of status checks include:

A) System connectivity Checks:

Loss of network connectivity
Loss of system power
Software issues on the physical host
Hardware issues on the physical host
B) Instance Status Checks:

Mis-configured networking or startup configuration
Exhausted memory
Corrupted file system
Incompatible kernel

Qns: How Many Types of User data:
Ans: You can pass two types of user data to Amazon EC2: shell scripts and cloud-init directives. You can also pass this data into the 
     launch wizard as plain text, as a file.


Qns: How Many Type of Security group in aws. and what is diff. b/w them.
Ans: There are two type of security in aws. 
      1. Security Group:  2. Nacl 
Difference. 
1.Security Group applied at the instance lavel where as Nacl applied at the Subnet lavel.
2. we can write the rules only open the communication. where as in Nacl we can write the rule for allow or deny the traffic.


Qns: What is Difference b/W public cloud and Private Cloud.
Ans: MicroSoft Window Azuer is example of public cloud .  the network, stoarge and memory are provided by the provider 
    for every one on the basic pay and use go. where private cloud is used only by the specific organization. 


Qns: Why we attach the security Group.
Ans: The Security Group is applied at the instance lavel. we attach the seurity group for the security group. with the help of security group 
     we can protect the unauthorized traffic at the instance for the safey purpose.


Qns: How Can Make the Ec2 instance is Public?
Ans: when we attch the router to the subnet where my instance is create. after that my instance will be public instance.


Qns: What is Load Balancer. And we can apply the load balance at the single instance or not?
Ans: The load Balancer automatically distribute the incoming web traffic at the applications and the containers which are hosted into the ec2 instance.
     and we do not apply the load Balancer at the single instance.


Qns: What is Route 53?
Ans: The route 53 is service in AWS . which are resolving the host name into the ip addresses and ip addresses into the host name.
     The Route 53 work as private dns in cloud. 

Qns: What is Role?
Ans: When we applied the any policy at the ec2 instance or service in aws . then this policy is called the Role.
    or You can say the role is service in aws which provide the service to the another service in AWS.
   for example: applied the ssm role at the instance.


Qns: What are metrics used in Autoscalig?

Qns: Tell me code or command to pull everything in linux machine.


Qns: i have  a s3 bucket in origen region and i want to this bucket into another region. how
Ans; To move an S3 bucket to a new region: Create a new S3 bucket in the destination region. 
     It must have a different name from your original bucket. Copy your data to the new bucket, using the console or the command line.

    or

If you need the new bucket to have the same name:

Create an intermediate bucket, you should set expiration rule so that this bucket and your data are deleted soon after your final 
copy to the destination bucket.
Copy your data
Delete the original buck...


Command line:
$ aws s3 cp s3://my-bucket/ s3://new-bucket/ --recursive
   aws s3 mv s3://my-bucket/ s3://-temp-bucket/ --recursive

monit is a utility for managing and monitoring processes, files, directories and filesystems on a Unix system.



Linux File System or any file system generally is a layer which is under the operating system that handles the positioning of your data
 on the storage,

Ext, Ext2, Ext3, Ext4, JFS, XFS, btrfs and swap


Why need a vpc:

in our vpc we can create the our resource like ec2 instance, rds etc. in secure way. we can protect the aws resource in each subnet. 
and you can use the multiple layer of the security. which include the security group and Nacl security.
