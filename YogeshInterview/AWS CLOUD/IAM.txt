what is IAM:
           AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) enables you to manage  and the access  AWS services and resources securely way. 
           Using IAM, you can create and manage AWS users and groups, 
           and use permissions to allow and deny their access to AWS resources. 


What is user:
          An AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) user is an entity that you create in AWS to represent the person or application that uses it to interact with AWS.
          A user in AWS consists of a name and credentials.An IAM user with administrator permissions is not the same thing as the AWS account 
          root user. For more information about the root user, see The AWS Account Root User.


What is Role:
         An IAM role is an IAM identity that you can create in your account that has specific permissions. An IAM role is similar to an IAM user.
         A role is service which provide the service to other services in aws account.
      
       Ex: BackUpRole: this role provide the service to another service (backup)  to take the back of any resource in aws. 

           Roles can be used by the following:
            An IAM user in the same AWS account as the role
            An IAM user in a different AWS account than the role



What is Policy:
           aws policy everything is a resource and each resource is identify by ARM(Amazon resource name).
            ex: you create a ec2 machine it will be ARM
                create a s3 it will be ARM
                general: you create any thing i aws its will be ARM.







Aws IAM(Identify & access management):

*user
    * giving access to access person /or non aws resource.
*Role
    * giving access to aws resources.
*policy
   * Resource(ARN)
   * Effect = Allow/Deny
   * Action:
* Group
     * set of users
     * set of policy.



in aws policy everything is a resource and each resource is identify by ARM(Amazon resource name).
ex: you create a ec2 machine it will be ARM
    tou create a s3 it will be ARM
general: you create any thing i aws its will be ARM.


note: you have a resource do you want access to it .or do not want to access to it.
     access /deny comes under the effect.


Action: you have a resource its have multiple action.
ex: you have a ec2 machine. the ec2 machine have multiple action.like stop,start and terminate.

user:
   the user is a not aws resource.or non aws entity. the user will get access or will not get the access depends on policy.
   
definition: the user is non aws entity and user something want to access the aws resource and user have the policy.

Roles:
   Giving the access the aws resource.
  ex: you create a ec2 machine and use it and want to stop another. ec2 machine use the role.

note: The user is a non aws resource entity ans role is a aws resource entity.
   
Policy:
  * it can be define as json file
  * it can be define as you use aws console.

but  aws understand the json
if you writing the policy you the json format.


qns: the user have a policy with allow everything.
     and this user add the group with deny everything . what happend.
  ans: deny everything

qns: group have allow everything and user have deny everythin and this user add to the group the what heppend.
ans:deny is always winner.

because deny have the higer priority.

 AWS IAM PRCTICE 15/04/2019

Create a user.

goto the aws console.
  service: IAM
  user name: tester(for non aws entity)
   programtic access. (no need user name and passwd)
   Aws Management access:(need user name passwd)

  .
  goto the service:
   ec2 machine
   i give the name of role:

note: role is givin to existing service. 
note:
  if you make the any user administractor it means it can access all the aws service.

what is action: the action is the activity. each action denote doing something for aws.
 ex: associate route table to the subnet.
  action : deny
then user not access the subnet.

  Service:
    choose: Ec2
Actions:
     list
      Read []
      write
Resource: all
Request condition:

 security group select all security group.
 resource :all
 policy name: managesecurity group
  create policy
  goto the user:
   addpermission
attatch existing policy.
search managesecurity group
 review
  addpermission:
now user have permission for cerate the security group and ec2 machine.

goto the deshboard and copy the link and paste the new tab browser.
and create the ec2 machine and security group.

 
here selection make the action .action is the activity.


********************************************************************

Conditional: actions:

ex: i give the permission to user to cerate or delete the security group 
   in ohai and orgen region not other region .how.

note:
    in amazon create any resource is called ARM.Amazon resource Management.

google:Arm for security group.

fisrt thing serach the region code of ohai.
accout-id: goto the our account and click and copy the account.
go the region orgen and goto the security group and copy the security id.
 region code:us-east-2
 account-id:
 security_group_id:

copy the this format 
and goto the policy and serch the managesg clcik json and change the resource action and paste the copy format.
 
and goto the other region like N.vergina and goto the security group and delete the security and its sho the error
 because user donot have a  permission in this region.

ex: goto the orgen region and goto the security group and deletye the security group  its success because user have a  permission.

********************************************************************************
ex: goto the policy 
    search the ec2reader 
    add permission
     edit json
