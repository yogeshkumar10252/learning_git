what is auto scaling group :
                        auto scaling group is group of ec2 machine in which you write the rules for increase or decrease the ec2 machine.
                        generally those rules depends on  system resource. some system resource are cpu utilization ,network harddisk etc.


Userdata: create a machine out of image some scripting runs only once is called the user data.

google: shabang 

#! /bin/bash
 sudo apt-get update
 sudo apt-get install stress -y


# Introduction to Scaling

* EC2 not meeting your needs
   * increase ram (cpu resources) in normal world (vertical scaling)
   * you can move to next instance size or any instance size 
   * AWS => Scale up & Scale down (elasticity)
   * if you have vertically scale => changing instance size/type we have to shutdown machine (means downtime)
   * changing size has zero impact on hard disk
   * stop instance & change instance size

   * Other kind of scaling is called as horizontal scaling
   * you dont change size but you add one/more ec2 instances
   * Concept: Auto Scaling Group, Load balancer, Target Groups

* Other Areas:
   * Every Ec2 machine machine has an ip address 
        * private ip address
        * public ip address
   * When you shutdown & start the machine 
        * private ip doesnt change
        * public ip changes
        * if you dont want to change public ip (Elastic IP) => EC2

AWS Autoscaling practice 22 May 2019

Step:
1. create a ec2 machine and install some application.
    ex: install the lampstack
2. create a image.
3. click on autoscaling group. get started
4. choose ami
5. launch configuration
                    name: ..
   userdata:
        #!/bin/bash
      sudo apt-get update
      sudo apt-get install stress -y
6. select the security group and open the 22 and 80 port.
7. select the key pair.
8 ok
9. create the Auto scaling group.
   * give the name of auto scaling group.
     select the network. choose default
     select subnet.
     click on advance option. no edit
10. Configure scaling ploicies.
      * use scaling ploicies to adjust the capicity of the group.
       scale b/w 1 to .. i choose 4
Increse Group Size.
 create the alarm
  whenever
   is >= 65    of cpu utilization

 Name of Alarm.....
  create a larm
Take the action.   1 instance.


Decrese the 
 create the Alarm
 Whenever  :
 is <= 50
For at least:
1    5 minute.
name of the alarm:... ex.
create alarm

Tale the action:
   remove 1

11. configure notification.
12. configure tag.
   .review
13 . click on view of auto scaling group.
14 . scroll down and click on ec2 machine.
15. copy the public ip and paste into the url:
    http://<public ip>/info.php
16. login into ec2 machine
17 create the load balancer
    choose classic load balancer
                 
17. goto the auto scalingscaling group
              edit
choose the load balancer name
                save
18. copy the dns name paste into the url
19. login into ec2 machine 
     run following command:
    sudo apt-get install stress -y
    stress --version
   stress --help
   copy the example  and run 

20. after some time machine automatically increse.
21. after increase the machine delete the machine , delete the load balancer and delete the autoscaling group. and delete the shanpshot and ami.
